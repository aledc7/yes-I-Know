# Intro  
(C) Yes, I know, (D) yes, I know,

__Verso 1:__  
```
Embracing life in my own way.
(A#7) Through the highs, (D#7) through the fakes,
Finding strength as my heart grows.
With every challenge, I'll rise above,
```

__Coro:__  
```
(Gm7) I'll rise like the sun in the sky,
(A#7) Spreading light as the days go by.
(Gm7) In every moment, I'll find my flow,
(A#7) Yes, I know, yes, Yes I know.
```

__Verso 2:__ 
```
(A#7) Shadows may come, (D#7) doubts may arise,
But I'll face them with open eyes.
(A#7) With determination, (D#7) I'll push through,
Confronting challenges, staying strong. 
```

 
__Coro:__  
```
(G) I'll rise like the sun in the sky,
(A#7) Spreading light as the days go by.
(G) In every moment, I'll find my flow,
(A#7) Yes, I know, Yes, I know
```
