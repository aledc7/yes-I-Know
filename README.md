## Letra Sola:   

Embracing life in my own way.
Through the highs, through the fakes,
Finding strength as my heart grows.
With every challenge, I'll rise above,


I'll rise like the sun in the sky,
Spreading light as the days go by.
In every moment, I'll find my flow,
Yes, I know, yes, Yes I know.

Shadows may come, doubts may arise,
But I'll face them with open eyes.
With determination, I'll push through,
Confronting challenges, staying strong.

I'll rise like the sun in the sky,
Spreading light as the days go by.
In every moment, I'll find my flow,
Yes, I know, yes, Yes I know.
